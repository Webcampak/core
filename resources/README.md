## cache/

Cache generated by Webcampak components. This cache can be cleared at anytime with limited risks. 

## database/

Contains the SQLite database used by Webcampak web app. Called webcampak.db, this database is mostly used to manage permissions and users and is not used by webcampak core.

## deleted/

Deleted sources are automatically moved to this directory instead of being deleted completely. 
This provides a safeguard to avoid pictures being deleted by mistake. 
Admins can then delete the source files manually via SSH or using the "wpresources" FTP account.

## emails/

Contains emails to be sent or already sent by Webcampak.
- queued: emails ready to be sent
- failed: emails which did not get sent for any reasons, files in this folder can be moved back to queue to try to send again
- sent: emails, classified by day, sent by Webcampak.

In its current configuration, the queue is processed every minute
