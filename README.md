Webcampak is a set of tools to reliably capture high definition pictures, at pre-defined interval, over a very long period of time and automatically generate timelapse videos. Built to scale and adapt to a variety of use cases, Webcampak will drive a DSLR camera from projects ranging from 6 months to years. Failsafe mechanisms are available to ensure no pictures get lost during that time.
